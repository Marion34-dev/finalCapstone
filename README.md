# Capstone IV: inventory.py

## About the program
This is a python program that reads from the inventory.txt file and allows stock management for a fictional shoe shop. It enables the user to view all shoes in stock, enter a new pair, search for a specific one, restock, calculate the total value for each pair in stock, and display special message for the pair with the highest quantity in stock. 

## Usage section
You can navigate through the menu and select the option you would like to try. The while loop enables the user to complete multiple actions before exiting the program.

## Installation section
You can download the software under the master branch of this project: https://github.com/Marion34-dev/finalCapstone/blob/master/inventory.py
